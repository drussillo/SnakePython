# Snake

This is my attempt at making snake with python!


# Notes:

### TODO:  
Bug Fixes
- Double apples bug (probably new apple spawning at same coords as old apple)
Graphics  
- Custom backgrounds for menu, fail, etc.
- Custom text
- HUD improvement
Obstacles
- Rocks: instant death
- Bumps: get shorter

### Ideas for future features (in priority order):  
Different apples  
- Normal apples (1 lenght)
- Big apples (2 lenght)
- Golden apples (5 lenght)
- Magical apples with effects  
            --> Speed boost with [spacebar]  
            --> Invulnerability / eat obstacles  
            --> 2x points!  
            --> Ouroboros? (every second of eating your tail adds a point)  

Obstacles
- dangerous animals  
            --> bird (insta death)  
            --> spider (poison shortens you)  
            --> scorpion (poison shortens you until you eat again)  
            --> ?  

Levels (bigger field, more obstacles, different obstacles; the higher the level, the harder it gets)
