# Snake

This is my attempt at making snake with python!


# _Notes:

TODO:
    - Start menu -> photoshop or gimp art?
    - Failstate screen improvement -> photoshop or gimp art?


Ideas for future features (in priority order):

    - Graphics
        -> Pixel art?
        
    - OST / sound
        -> death 
        -> eat
        -> bgm?
        
    - Different apples
        -> Normal apples (1 lenght)
        -> Big apples (2 lenght)
        -> Golden apples (5 lenght)
        -> Magical apples with effects
            --> Speed boost with [spacebar]
            --> Invulnerability / eat obstacles
            --> 2x points!
            --> Ouroboros? (every second of eating your tail adds a point)

    - Obstacles
        -> rocks (kill you)
        -> bumps (shorten you)
        -> dangerous animals 
            --> bird (insta death)
            --> spider (poison shortens you)
            --> scorpion (poison shortens you until you eat again)
            --> ?

    - Levels? (bigger field, more obstacles, different obstacles)
        -> the higher the level, the harder it gets
